Challenges on this Project: The Module dotenv was not found when I had tried to run the code so I had to install the "python-dotenv" as a form of user installation. Hereâ€™s a more polished and elaborated version for your README file:

### **Challenges Encountered**
One of the challenges I faced during this project was that the `dotenv` module was not found when I initially tried to run the code. This error occurred because the required dependency was not installed in my environment. To resolve this, I installed the `python-dotenv` package using a user-level installation (`pip install python-dotenv`). This ensured that the environment variables from the `.env` file could be properly loaded and utilized by the application.

**Lesson Learned:**  
Always ensure that all necessary dependencies are listed in the project requirements and that the environment is correctly set up before running the code. Adding a `requirements.txt` file can help streamline this process for others working on the project.
